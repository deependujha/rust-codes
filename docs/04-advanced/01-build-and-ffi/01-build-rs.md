# `build.rs` in Rust Projects

- The `build.rs` file is a special build script in Rust projects that allows you to customize the build process.
- It is executed before the main compilation of your crate and can be used for various tasks such as:
    - generating code
    - compiling C/C++ code
    - or setting up environment variables.
